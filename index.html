                <p class="lead mb-4">The linebacker, particularly the Middle Linebacker (MLB), is called the "quarterback of the defense" because they are the defensive leader and communicator. They receive the play call from the sideline coach and relay it to the other players. Additionally, they often make pre-snap adjustments to the formation based on the offense's alignment. This central role in directing and coordinating the defense is similar to an offensive quarterback's responsibilities.</p>

                    <h5>Ray Lewis</h5>
                    <h7>
                        Ray Lewis was an exceptionally dominant Middle Linebacker for the Baltimore Ravens from 1996 to 2012. He was renowned for his leadership, high football IQ, and intense play against both the run and the pass. Lewis's stellar career includes winning two Super Bowl Championships (Super Bowl XXXV, where he was named MVP, and XLVII), earning the NFL Defensive Player of the Year award twice, and being selected to a record 13 Pro Bowls for his position. He holds the unique NFL distinction of being the only player with over 40 sacks and 30 interceptions, and he is the all-time leader in combined and solo tackles with over 2,000. He was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2018.

                        <h7>
                            Lawrence Taylor was a revolutionary and exceptionally dominant Outside Linebacker for the New York Giants from 1981 to 1993. His unmatched speed, power, and ferocity as a pass rusher fundamentally changed NFL offenses, forcing teams to alter their blocking schemes to contain him. He had one of the most decorated defensive careers in history, including winning the NFL MVP award in 1986 (one of only two defensive players ever to do so), being named the NFL Defensive Player of the Year three times, and winning two Super Bowls (XXI and XXV). He was selected to 10 Pro Bowls, earned 8 First-team All-Pro selections, finished his career with 132.5 official sacks, and was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1999.

                    <h7>
                        Dick Butkus, who played for the Chicago Bears from 1965 to 1973 as a Middle Linebacker, is remembered as one of the most ferocious and feared tacklers in NFL history, earning him the nickname "The Enforcer." He was exceptionally skilled at forcing turnovers, recording 22 career interceptions and setting a then-record of 27 recovered fumbles upon his retirement. His exceptional nine-year career included 8 Pro Bowl selections, 5 First-team All-Pro selections, and 2 NFL Defensive Player of the Year awards (1969, 1970). Butkus was named to the NFL's All-Decade Teams for the 1960s and 1970s and was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1979. His enduring legacy is honored annually by the Butkus Award, given to the top linebacker in college and the NFL.

            <img src="img/Linebackers24.jpg">
            <h6 class="other">
            As a Linebacker, you get to be the ultimate playmaker on defense and basically the boss of the whole defense. You're lined up right where the action starts, meaning you're going to get a chance to make a tackle on almost every play, whether the offense is running the ball or passing it. If you are strong and love to hit people, you get to shut down running backs. If you're quick and smart, you get to drop back and make a great play on the ball. You have to be tough and fast, but if you want to be the defensive leader who is involved in everything, the linebacker position is definitely the one for you.
